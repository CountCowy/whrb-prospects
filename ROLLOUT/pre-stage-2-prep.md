# Pre-Stage-2 prep (2026-04-17, post-Stage-1)

Captured per plan round-6 clarifications addendum. Logged here so the Stage 2
entry state is explicit.

- **`notes` → `pipeline_notes` rename completed.** `pipeline.py::CSV_COLUMNS`,
  `pipeline.py::score()`, and every `"notes"` dict-key write in
  `sources/{chambers,city_licenses,ma_hic,bbb,program_books,program_books_fetcher,ma_sos}.py`
  and `enrich/{apollo_free,hunter_free}.py` now write `pipeline_notes`. Grep
  confirms zero remaining scraped-field `"notes"` references. The DB's
  `public.prospect_notes` table is unrelated and untouched.
- **Stage 1 integrity tests NOT re-run** before Stage 2 — Stage 1 just exited
  green and nothing in the DB tree changed since.
- **No intermediate pipeline dry run.** Stage 2's `python pipeline.py --fresh
  --with-hic` will be the first ingest against `WHRB dev`.
- **Stage 2 will seed `public.source_config`** with one row per scraper
  (`osm`, `yelp`, `ma_hic`, `city_licenses`, `chambers`, `best_of_boston`,
  `program_books`, `huntington`, `bbb`), all `enabled=true`, idempotent.
- **Stage 2 network-kill test will be simulated**, not a manual wifi toggle
  (plan deviation — reason + method will be documented in the Stage 2 entry
  when it is written).
- **Stage 2 target**: `WHRB dev` project (`kolfijjavwruwzctmnlx`) directly, no
  staging table.

### Stage 2 implementation decisions (plan round-7, 2026-04-18)

Captured before Stage 2 implementation work begins. Full text lives in the plan's round-7 addendum; summary here so `ROLLOUT.md` is self-contained.

- **Universal `pipeline_run_id`.** Every run (CLI + web) inserts a `pipeline_runs` row at start and updates it at finish. Every `event_log` row is stamped with that `pipeline_run_id`. CLI runs use `triggered_by=null`; `args` captures argv (e.g. `"--fresh --with-hic"`).
- **`--no-supabase`** CLI flag skips phase `08_supabase_sync` only; composes with `--dry`.
- **Per-batch retry** lives in `db/supabase_sync.py` (tenacity, 3 attempts, reuses `util/http.py::RETRYABLE_EXCEPTIONS`). Exhausted batch → `event_log` error; sync continues with the next batch.
- **`priority_score`** authoritative-from-pipeline, always refreshed, still honors `user_overrides["priority_score"]`.
- **`util/http.py` logging:** `scrape_4xx` → `warn`, `scrape_http` (retry exhaustion) → `error`. Fire-and-forget; must never raise.
- **Integrity script:** `whrb-prospects/scripts/stage2_integrity.py` (centralized, modeled on `stage1_integrity.py`). `--simulate-network-kill` flag runs the monkey-patched-`upsert` retry test in isolation.
- **Branch:** `stage2/pipeline-sync` off `main`. Commit + push only after every integrity test is green; push to existing remote (verified first, not created).
- **`--fresh`** clears phase/source checkpoints but **leaves `cache/http_cache.sqlite` alone**.
- **Pipeline execution hand-off:** Claude runs `python pipeline.py --fresh --with-hic` via Bash `run_in_background=true` (no 10-min timeout).
